Add 'sudo' in order to avoid having to enter the sudo password when the server is already running and client sends a query.
```sudo python3 server.py```

On another terminal:
```python3 client.py```

Currently the code accepts only one query per client as it is just a simple demo. The client side script can be modified to accept more queries.
